A short note here about extending LVM2 partitions, as I haven't found it
anywhere else (though I haven't searched too much, I admit):

# fdisk /dev/sda
# # Add partition, type 8e, save, quite and likely restart the machine.
# # If it's a virtual machine (as it's very likely), you don't need to care
# # about the number of primary partitions, actually. If your brain bugs,
# # keep in mind that you can create /dev/sdb afterwards and add it into
# # your volume gorup.
# vgextend VolumeName /dev/sdaX
# vgdisplay
# # The first number from line which begins "Free  PE / Size" is all you
# # need if you want to just add some space to your server. Documentation
# # usually insists that you should give the absolute number, instead of
# # relatively increasing the partition.
# lvextend -l +<that_number> /dev/VolumeName/Partition
# # No need for reboot after this. (No need neither for 2.6.32 kernels nor
# # for 4.x kernels.)
# resize2fs /dev/VlumeName/Partition
# # No need for reboot after this, as well.
