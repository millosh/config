How to get A+ on ssllabs.com and have a decent security. Apache 2.4 on
Debian 9.

# # You will need mod_headers

# <editor> /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ssl.conf
# # Remove everything from the generic file and add the following:

Your SSL virtual host file should have just turning on SSL and the keys
(including the whole chain).

Note that some web systems are setting their own headers. That's not a
problem usually, however you shouldn't have HSTS defined two times. If
ssllabs.com says that you have it defined in two places, check .htaccess
file from the document root or the relevant place of software you are using
(Scurity Kit in Drupal, for example).

The documentation is not finished, but if you install fresh Debian 9, update
it and install Apache there, you will get A+ and everything 100% covered on
ssllabs.com except the key exchange.

I will update this documentation in the future.
